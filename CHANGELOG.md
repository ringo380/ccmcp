All notable changes to this project are documented here. Format based on

[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] — 2026-04-20

### Added

- **`?` help overlay** in the TUI: a full-screen legend describing every
  source badge (`[u]` / `[l]` / `[p]` / `[P]` / `[@]` / `[s]` / `[?]`),
  every row mark (`[x]` / `[~]` / `[ ]` / `[!]`), and every key binding
  grouped by tab — including the `m`-move sub-prompt (`u`/`l`/`s`/esc)
  that was previously only visible when triggered. Close with `?` or
  `esc`. Discoverable via the new footer hint (`?: help`).
- `ccmcp tui --dump --tab help` dumps the legend as plain text for
  non-interactive inspection.
- **Bulk `A` / `N` toggle on the MCPs tab** (previously only on the
  Plugins tab): batched equivalent of per-row `space`, scope-aware,
  respects the active filter. Turns `/plugin` + `<enter>` + `N` + `w`
  into a four-keystroke workflow for "disable every plugin-registered
  MCP for this project".

### Changed

- **CI**: bumped `actions/checkout` v4→v6, `actions/setup-go` v5→v6,
  `goreleaser/goreleaser-action` v6→v7 ahead of the 2026-06-02 Node.js
  20 deprecation on GitHub runners. Goreleaser v2 config unchanged.
- Footer hint updated to include `?: help` so the overlay is discoverable.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-20

Initial public release.

### Added

- Interactive `bubbletea` TUI with four tabs: MCPs, Plugins, Profiles, Summary.
- Effective-view default that shows every MCP which will actually load in the
  current project, with source badges (`u` user, `l` local, `p` project `.mcp.json`,
  `P` plugin-bundled, `@` claude.ai, `s` stash) and `[x]` / `[~]` / `[ ]` marks.
- Per-row `space` toggle and bulk `A` / `N` that respect the active filter
  and scope, so `/plugin` + `<enter>` + `N` disables every plugin-registered
  MCP for the current project in one keystroke.
- `m` move action to relocate an MCP's config between user / local / stash
  scopes; plugin-sourced rows copy their bundled config with a duplicate-load
  warning.
- Scope cycling (`s`) across effective → local → user → project → stash.
- CLI subcommands:
  - `ccmcp status [--json]`
  - `ccmcp mcp list|enable|disable|stash|restore|move|override`
  - `ccmcp profile save|list|show|use|delete`
  - `ccmcp plugin list|enable|disable|install|remove`
  - `ccmcp marketplace list|add|remove`
  - `ccmcp tui --dump [--tab ...]` for headless diagnostics
- Back-compat aliases for the prior bash prototype: `apply`, `stash-user`,
  `restore-user`, `use-profile`, `save-profile`, `list-profiles`, `show-profile`,
  `remove-local`, `clear-local`.
- Per-project override management (`disabledMcpServers`) with the same
  prefix encoding Claude Code's `/mcp` dialog uses: plain (stdio),
  `claude.ai <Name>`, `plugin:<plugin>:<server>`.
- Plugin installer supporting all four marketplace source formats: bare-string
  subdir, `url`, `git-subdir`, `github`.
- Atomic writes (temp file + `fsync` + rename) with timestamped backups in
  `~/.claude-mcp-backups/`, same-second collision counter, leading-dot stripping.
- `--dry-run` on every mutating command (verified by
  `TestCLIDryRunDoesNotWrite`).
- 61-test suite across config readers / CLI sandbox / installer / headless TUI
  state machine.
